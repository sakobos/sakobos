# Introduction
Welcome to my page.  

## Background
I have been hedging my bets as it pertains to my professional baseball career by preparing myself for life once my career is over by self-studying coding, data science, and machine learning. 

My interest in data science began after adding a minor in applied statistics while at Coastal Carolina to fill the credit hours requirement needed to maintain NCAA eligibility after season-ending elbow surgery in the spring of 2018. While I did not complete the statistics minor due to scheduling conflicts with the physics major, I was introduced to the R programming language and was blown away by the capabilities of the program. So much so, that I decided to incorporate some statistical analysis into my capstone project in the fall of 2019. 

After graduating in the spring of 2020, I signed a contract to play professional baseball with the Chicago Cubs organization. With the lockdowns of the COVID pandemic, the minor league baseball season was canceled, so I was left with a significant amount of time on my hands. I thought there was no better way to use this extra time than to stay mentally sharp and prepare for a career I would most likely need once my baseball career was over. 

I began learning Python, R, and SQL from YouTube videos and from there took up learning data analytics, data science, and machine learning from various sources. I knew I had found what I wanted to do after baseball. This GitHub profile serves as my data science portfolio.

Please take a look at my projects and if you like my work, let me know, if you don't, feel free to leave me some constructive criticism.
